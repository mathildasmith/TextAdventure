*A few lines of description of what classes have been added or updated and what functions have been implemented in them (even if they were not ready yet)
I have actually almost completed the main class, however I can't run any tests because somehow I cannot get my main classs into the class that I linked with github.
So as of right now, it is just a free class that I cannot debug or run or do anything with, so I have no idea what state it is 
in but it seems correct to me.

*What methods / functionality have been tested so far in classes so that they work properly?
Like I said, I don't know if they work, but I have completed my method that asks for the users favorite food, restaurant, and
what allergies they have. I have completed the class that would then remove the foods they are allergic to from the menu,
and have completed the class that filters to the best restaurant for the user. I am working on the method that would then 
filter out the foods to cater to their favorite, which would then finally return a method and recommendation for where they
should eat and what.

*What possible difficult errors have occurred and have they been resolved?
Biggest problem is either getting this to github/getting it to actually work in eclipse.

*What is the workload used during this time with 5 hours accuracy
I would say I have spent about 10-15 hours on this so far.

*Whether you are ahead or lagging behind what you presented in the project plan at roughly this stage.
I would say (other than not being able to get it to run or work) I am actually where I expected myself to be.
